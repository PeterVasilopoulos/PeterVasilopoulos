## Don't Quote Me On This &ensp; ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngi94hN5LOU) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@petervasilopoulos/dont-quote-me-on-this-python-project-15324eb3e803)) 
#### &ensp; 🧰 (Python, Flask, MySQL)
&ensp; Movie quote guessing game where a random movie quote is generated and the user has to guess the movie it's from.
- streamlined the movie guessing experience for users by performing string sanitization
- used an asynchronous fetch request to allow the rest of the page to load while the quote is being pulled from the api (it's not a very fast api)
