## Don't Quote Me On This
#### &ensp; (Python, Flask, MySQL)
&ensp; Movie quote guessing game where a random movie quote is generated and the user has to guess the movie it's from.
- created a function to perform string sanitization to make the user guessing experience more forgiving
- used an asynchronous fetch request to allow the rest of the page to load while the quote is being pulled from the api (it's not a very fast api)
